# Flexnotes 
Is minimal client for my flexnotes backend: [repo](https://github.com/krxxys/flexnotes) written with Vue/PrimeVue/Tailwind. Flexnotes-client includes login/register form with validation(yup and vee-validate). Markdown and katex support to write math notes. "Focus area" with pomodoro timer and todo system. It's just minimal and works as it should works :)
## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krxxys/flexnotes-client.git
cd  flexnotes-client
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
